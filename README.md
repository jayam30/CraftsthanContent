Team Craftस्थान Idea Descriptions
We at Craftस्थान are trying to create an E-commerce website that is the one-stop solution to all the problems of the artisan industry and the aim is to promote the artisans as well as the industry all over the globe. We are aiming to solve most of the problems faced by artisans by analyzing and studying the market trend and solving existing problems. The problems that this industry is currently facing are:

1) Unavailability of AR Feature:

In most of the e-commerce website the Ar feature has not been implemented yet, although some of the websites such as Lenskart have started it but have limited it to the eye wear category.  One of the reason for the biggest loss when it comes  E-commerce industry in fashion and clothing is that they do not allow people to try on clothes using Augmented Reality feature due to which although people might buy something from the website but when it gets delivered to them they do not like it much and thus end up returning the product which is a loss to the company as they have spent money on delivering the product which cannot get refunded.

2) Idea to combat high Competition from the Industries using machines: 

Machine-based handloom/handicraft industry is one of the main competitors of the handmade handloom/handicraft industry. In order to empower the handmade handloom/handicraft industry we need to shift a major chunk of our market spread from the fashion and lifestyle category to the gift industry, by this we will not only end up having a larger market cap for the artisans but also will help the industry to grow exponentially. This shifting of the categorization of the products will be done partially by adding a special feature to our website which is the Customization of the products available on our website in which we can basically choose any product and any design that we find attractive on the product and can have the same design on the product and get it delivered to us. In the Designing feature, we are also giving an option to either upload a design template the buyer already has or s/he can even get any names printed on the product. This feature will not only give a personalized touch to the products bought which will increase the engagement on our website also will give the user a reason to choose our site over other similar sites.

3) Giving Fixed Income opportunities to the Artisans

Craftsmen usually do not have a fixed income from any source, moreover, they cannot remain dependent on the profit earned by sales as it fluctuates with time and also the profit earned by them as a result of listing on various other already existing E-commerce websites like Amazon or Flipkart due to the fees charged by these sites, for instance, Amazon charges a whopping 17% on the sales made by the artisans in the clothing sector that reduces the profits made by these artisans to such an amount that it does not make much of a difference in their living conditions as these sites usually take a big chunk of the profit as commission. We had to solve this problem at all costs as it was affecting the artisans largely and is thus making them end their careers so we came up with a solution according to which we will connect the artisans directly to Big Brands/Companies where they can sign a contract or basically a legal document protecting their rights and according to which the companies can list their products/design templates on the companies websites and can earn royalty directly. Moreover, the artisans can also work with the companies on a freelancing basis as mentioned in the contract thus earning money from the freelancing.

4) Multilingual Website:

A major problem why most of the artisans cannot deal with the people abroad is that they usually speak their native language, but it is not necessary that the artisan is comfortable with that language, moreover, users are more comfortable with their mother tongue so in order to solve both of these problems we are trying to build our website in multiples languages which makes it extremely easy to use for the user and also enhances the user experience on our website. We are initially starting with two languages that are Hindi and English but in the near future, we will be updating our website with which the user will be able to see the site in multiple languages. 

5) Credit System: 

Craftsmen face problems with their business as they do not have funds  arranged beforehand for their business but they are dependent on the profit earned by the sale of the items made by them, so in order to solve this problem we have added a feature of prepaid customizable orders in which buyers can give customization instructions for their order to the artisans but in order to place the order the customer will have to pay half the cost price of the product in advance, by doing this we are not only solving the funding problem of the artisan but also we are assuring the artisans that if they have put in extra effort on customizing the products then the order will have very less probability to get cancelled as the buyer has already payed half of the cost price which will act as relief to the artisans as earlier even if the artisan put extra effort in customizing then also the order could get cancelled which not only wastes the resources and time of the artisan but also prefer the physical market over online market.

6) Product Suggestions:

Generally, craftsmen are highly skilled but the products that are built by them are either out of the trend or the people are unaware of them. Since we are creating an E-commerce website specifically for the artisans so their art will come into the spotlight directly thus solving the less awareness problem whereas when we talk about the trend problem-the basic reason behind this is that the artisans are generally not aware of market trends-So in order to solve this problem, in particular, we are adding a special feature for the artisans that is product recommendation in which we will be studying the current market analytics and thus we will recommend the artisan to build/create products related to the product suggested so that the products created by them come under the trend and thus help the artisan to increase their profits.

7 ) User Analytics:

We are supplying user analytics to the artisans so that they can see the sales of various products created by them. They usually create varieties of products but some of them have very low sales due to various possible reasons which lead to huge losses. In order to avoid this, we will be providing the artisans with the user analytics as it will tell them which product has more demand and which one has low so that they can create the products accordingly in order to minimize the losses.

8) Absence of Design in the Market

This has been a constant problem for the buyers nowadays as they only find similar types of designs on all clothing range present in the market, this not only caused a lack of interest in shopping among the individuals as they do not find the design that pleases them easily moreover even if they find the design they want they might not end up liking the color of the product so in order to solve this problem we are providing the customers an option that they can upload design templates that they preferred to be present on their clothes or the artifacts that are being bought by them.

Since we have discussed the problem statements that team Craftस्थान is trying to solve so we must make everyone aware of the ways in which we will be implementing our ideas. So here we have listed the method of implementation of all the problems with the same headings as mentioned in the problem so that it is easy for anyone to locate.

1) Unavailability of AR Feature:

We at Craftस्थान are trying to solve this prime problem by adding the AR Try On Feature on our website. Although we are at an early stage of the solution but we see ourselves developing it in the future, this will not only enhance the user experience but it will allow users to see how they actually look while using the product this feature can be used just by clicking on a link or scanning the QR code with Snapchat. As Snapchat is used by millions of users and in this way this feature will open the scope of marketing via Snapchat as well. 

2) Absence of Design in the Market

As we have already given a detailed statement on this problem above we are aiming to solve this by adding a custom product and design option on our website where the customers can select the design templates uploaded by the seller as well as they can upload the design templates that they have or which have been created by them and they will be delivered the product with the design of their choice which will attract the customers as they are getting items of their choice along with the design also chosen by them in very less time when compared to other websites thus increasing the traffic on our website which will indirectly help the artisans as the number of orders given to them will increase.

3) Giving Fixed Income opportunities to the Artisans

As we have given a very detailed explanation of this problem above we will be focusing on solving it in the best way possible one of which is that we will provide a platform where the pre-established popular brands can connect to the artisans directly i.e., they can give the artisans large order of items which will be listed on their websites but in all this, our website will be central as the artisans and the companies will be in a legal contract and can deal with the artisans only through our website. We have created a different portal for brands where they can directly register themselves and can search for the products that they want to list on their websites. 

4) Multilingual Website:

This problem also has been explained above and as a solution to this we will make our website multilingual starting with English and Hindi as language options in the very beginning but the language options will be increased in the future.

5) Credit System: 

We will be adding a solution for the credit problem of the artisans as the people will have to pay half of the cost price for the article they are giving for customizing so that there is no loss on the artisan side if he/she puts extra effort for that order. 

6) Product Suggestions:

The artisans will be getting product recommendations on our website which will be given according to their sales on our website. 

7) User Analytics:

We will be providing the user analytics to the artisan so that if they want they can analyze their sales and can make the changes to their stock or their designs accordingly. Even if the artisan is not familiar with the graphs, they will be shown the analytics in the simplest way possible so that it is easy for them to understand it. Moreover, even if the artisans do not analyze their data we will be giving them product recommendations which will be even more helpful for them to adjust to the ongoing trends.

As we have already talked about the problems being faced by the artisans and the implementation of solutions to these problems, we will also discuss the features that we will add to our website in the future in order to make them even more user-friendly and easy to use:

Future plans of Team Craftस्थान: 

The main aim of team Craftस्थान is to create ease in selling local products on a worldwide level and to  empower them, we are working on some of the features that will be added in the future which will be extra beneficial for the sellers as well as the buyers: 

1. AR (Augmented Reality)

We will be working on developing our website based on our own  augmented reality that is when we will not be dependent on any third party and will implement this on a wide range of products and more precise like with the help of sufficient funds and with R&D our AR can also predicted size of cloths that will fit best. Although for the prototype we have taken help from Snapchat in order to implement the AR feature. We have worked in the extended time given to us and added the AR Feature on our website thus adding only one sticker for trial purpose. In order to use the sticker one should have Snapchat installed in their phones and logged in, then they can scan QR Code attached under the Virtual Reality Button on our website to see it.

1. Payment Methodology 

Currently, we are collaborating with the most trusted and highly secured Payment Gateway companies for completing payments on our website but in the near future, we will be focusing on developing a highly secure payment gateway of our own for the website. 

1. Supply chain system 

We will be focusing on building a better supply chain system so that we can make our website even more efficient and we can reduce the delivery time to the minimum possible.

1.  Auction

We will be adding this feature on our website in the future in which the artisans can upload one of their artifact each month which they think has some special feature or which is their best creation and then the people can bid on these artifacts. This helps the sellers as usually the cost at which the items are sold in an auction is more than when they are sold in a shop, moreover this feature will attract the people who enjoy bidding and they might end up buying one of the listed items which will increase the traffic on our website.

1. Coin System

We will be releasing a coin system in the future according to which whenever a buyer buys a product a fixed share of the cost price is given to them in the form of coins which can redeemed on our website in the form of a discount on their next purchase or they can directly transfer these coins to their bank account. Similarly when a seller’s sales passes a fixed amount then their account is credited by some coins which he can redeem to transfer them into their bank account or to redeem some discount if they but the base materials also from our website. If people transfer these coins in their bank account then their bank will be credited with a fixed amount which will be calculated with the help of the actual denomination attached to one coin.

1. Additional Mode Of Payment

We will be focusing on incorporating the Crypto payment gateway on our website in the future so that people can pay in Bitcoin, Ethereum, or any other digital currency for the items they are buying from our website.

We have also attached a case study on the topic of Columbia Falls Pottery to describe the basis of our idea below:

Columbia Falls Pottery
Columbia Falls, Maine
April Adams, Owner, and Artist
[www.columbiafallspottery.com](http://www.columbiafallspottery.com/)
Columbia Falls Pottery’s experience with e-commerce shows the potential that exists for
rural artisans to extend their markets beyond regional borders and to become less
dependent on seasonal tourism for success. The artist is choosing to move the business
from one that generated some seasonal employment opportunities to a successful self-employment enterprise that will rely on e-commerce as essential to her long-term goals
for the business. She plans to grow the online component while reducing her dependence
on retail sales. Her effective use of e-commerce will keep Columbia Falls Pottery in rural
coastal Maine well into the future and allow this lifestyle entrepreneur to pursue both her
business and her artistic dreams.
Profile
Columbia Falls Pottery, owned by potter April Adams, is located in Columbia Falls,
Maine. April Adams produces and sells pottery in several distinctive patterns, along with
tiles and tile murals, and clocks. Currently, she produces all of her products; in the past,
she has sold at volumes that required sub-contracting with other potters in the region who
would produce “blanks” that she finished with her unique decorations and glazes. In
addition to her standard patterns and designs, April does custom design work.
Columbia Falls Pottery has a retail presence in Columbia Falls, located in a historic
building on the main street. The store is open during the tourist season and by
appointment during the spring. Production occurs in the back of the retail space. In the
past, the retail operation required full-time sales help in July and August, and part-time
production assistance during the same period. At the height of her business volume, in 2000,
the business had a full-time salesperson, production assistant, and two sub-contractors.
Current plans are to relocate the retail operation after this season to a shared retail space
on the main street, reducing the time and operating costs associated with operating a
retail storefront, while expanding the e-commerce side of the business.
History
April Adams, a Maine native, has been a full-time potter since graduating from the
Portland School of Art, practicing her craft for 37 years. She began doing craft shows and
wholesaling her work but recognized that potters who had done well with their business
in Maine had access to the retail and tourism markets. In 1990, she moved to Columbia
Falls and opened her retail business on the main street in town. As a result, 95% of her
business became generated by the retail market while 5% was received from the
wholesale market.
A turning point for the business came following 9/11. Most of her business had been
walk-in retail sales but that activity declined after 9/11. The tourist trade that made up
the majority of her sales – 60% of her sales occurred between May and October –

declined significantly. From 9/11 until last year, sales continued to decline, associated
with the decline in tourism that April does not see returning to earlier levels. At the same
time, operating the retail space was becoming an increasing burden on April. At the
height of her business in 2000, she was spending more time managing the business than
she was spending on the artistic aspects of production. And, the historic retail storefront,
renovated when she started the business in 1990, was in need of additional renovation
and maintenance – an unwelcome prospect for April at this point in her life.
These factors came together to suggest the need for a refocusing of the business in a new
direction. What the business needed was a way to have more off-season sales and to bring
in out-of-region sales. While Columbia Falls Pottery has had a website since 1998, it
served primarily as an online informational brochure about the artist and her pottery. Any
sales generated by the website came the old fashioned way – through a follow up visit or
call to the store to place an order. In 2000, April began the process of expanding her ecommerce capability as a way of changing the direction of the business and helping her
refocus her energies on her role as the creative talent behind the business.
Business Location
Columbia Falls, Maine was established in the late 1700s as a shipbuilding and lumber
town. Like many small Maine coastal communities, these industries are now part of
community history, replaced by tourism and, to a lesser extent, agriculture, specifically
blueberries and seafood. While many of the town’s businesses rely on the seasonal tourist
trade, most residents commute out of the town to work. In 2000, the town’s population
was 599. Located in nonmetropolitan Washington County (2000 population, 33,941),
Columbia Falls is 143 miles north of Maine’s largest metropolitan area, Portland.
Role of E-Commerce
The e-commerce capability of the Columbia Falls Pottery website developed over time.
Online ordering began in 2000 using a system where customers submitted an order and
payment information online, which went to the webmaster. The webmaster, in turn,
would fax this information to the retail store where it was processed just like any phone
order that was received. Over time, the sales associated with online ordering increased
but there was no active management of the e-commerce component of the site. In fact,
April did not get a computer until 2003.
A turning point occurred in 2003 when the webmaster abruptly left, taking the technical
knowledge of the website with him. Fortunately, April owned the domain name but she
still had to start over with web development. This misfortune, however, had a silver
lining in terms of her engagement in the web development and e-commerce side of the
business. April identified a local webmaster and began to build her skill set regarding e-commerce. She took part in workshops on e-commerce sponsored by the Maine
Women’s Business Center at Coastal Enterprises, Inc. and made a commitment to
building the e-commerce side of her business. As April stated, she is committed to the
success of e-commerce because it is the only way to market to a wider audience and 
allow her to get back to being an artist again.

The process of building the e-commerce site took planning and time. Between 2003 and
2005, the new website was developed. In 2005, her tiles and her custom commissions
increased and the website was revamped in 2006 to feature the tiles. The final step in the
e-commerce process was implementing a shopping cart to handle the online ordering and
payment processing. The decision about which shopping cart to use required more
research and decision-making. April did not want to use Pay Pal and she wanted to have
some control over the design of the shopping cart. As a result, Columbia Falls Pottery
purchased a shopping cart that provides the calculation of real-time shipping and does instant
ordering and payment processing. The shopping cart was installed in early 2007,
completing the transition to a full e-commerce site.
Actual out-of-pocket costs to start up the e-commerce site were about $6,400 for web
development and the purchase and installation of the shopping cart. That figure does not
include the time spent by April to create the photos for the site, write the text, and
develop policies and procedures for online sales, such as shipping and returns. However,
monthly operating costs for e-commerce are very low since the shopping cart is owned by
the credit card processing company that charges a low $15 per month. Web hosting is $95
a year. These costs are projected to be covered by additional sales within the next year.
Challenges and Lessons for Rural Entrepreneurs
The experience of April Adams and Columbia Falls Pottery highlights some challenges
and provides a number of lessons for other rural businesses considering e-commerce.

- One of the biggest challenges to the successful implementation of e-commerce
involves managing the website to increase the business’s visibility on search
engines, e.g., getting on the “first-page” of a Google search. Enhancing visibility
to search engines requires constant management of keywords, and links, and
consideration of services that promise to increase exposure to search engines. For
an artisan, it also means that quality pictures alone are not enough to optimize
web presence – it is the text and keywords that are picked up by search engines.
Site optimization is a challenge that April continues to face.
- The adoption of e-commerce capability requires time and planning. It took April
more than two years to fully implement e-commerce as she struggled to fit its
development into her already full schedule of running the business. The actual
launch of the shopping cart occurred during the winter months – the business’s
slow season – when April could devote her full attention to the details of the
website's transition to e-commerce. An alternative for other rural businesses is to
hire professional services to do the work or to hire additional staff to manage the
e-commerce function. In the case of Columbia Falls Pottery, assuming these
additional costs were not feasible so existing capacity had to be used to build eCommerce capability.
- Businesses should do their homework about e-commerce before they start. The
workshops offered by the Maine Women’s Business Center were very valuable in
terms of providing information and raising issues that April had not considered. In
addition, she did her own research – viewing other pottery websites to see what
features she liked, looking at the features of different shopping carts, etc.
- There was nothing about the rural location of the business in Columbia Falls that
made her e-commerce endeavor more difficult. Up until early 2007, Internet
service was provided through dial-up but there is no broadband access. She was
able to find a web developer locally and support resources were also available in
the state.
- Undertaking e-commerce requires a real commitment to the process and
perseverance when roadblocks are encountered. But, for this business, the
transition to e-commerce represented a way to move more completely from retail
to online sales and, as of April states, it does not matter how long it takes, “it has to
work.”
